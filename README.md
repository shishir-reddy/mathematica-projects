## demonstrations
A collection of demonstrations I've published to the [Wolfram Demonstrations Site](http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/author.html?author=Shishir+Reddy) as well as any projects that demonstrate an idea or concept.

## misc-projects
Projects that I did through high school with various ideas such as cellular automata, fractals, 3D printing and graphics, music, and other extensions of those concepts.

## music-digitizer
An attempt to recognize and extract musical notation from a staff.

## music-recognition
A project that uses Fast Fourier Transforms in Mathematica to transcribe an audio file into musical notes based on frequency. It also includes noise reduction software using Discrete Wavelet Transforms to detect and process noise out of a sound file.
